 * Tracks the value and validity state of an array of `FormControl`,

 * It calculates its status by reducing the status values of its children. For example, if one of
 * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormGroup`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create an array of form controls
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   new FormControl('Drew'),
 * ]);
 *
 * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']
 * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form array with array-level validators
 *
 * You include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy
 * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child
 * control.
 *
 * The two types of validators are passed in separately as the second and third arg
 * respectively, or together as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy'),
 *   new FormControl('Drew')
 * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});
 * ```
 *
  * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form array
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * array level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *    new FormControl()
 * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding or removing controls from a form array
 *
 * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, `removeAt` or `clear` methods
 * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the
 * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate
 * the `FormArray` directly, as that result in strange and unexpected behavior such
 * as broken change detection.

/**
 * Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
 *
 * This is one of the three fundamental building blocks of Angular forms, along with
 * `FormGroup` and `FormArray`. It extends the `AbstractControl` class that
 * implements most of the base functionality for accessing the value, validation status,
 * user interactions and events.
 *
 * @see `AbstractControl`
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 * @see [Usage Notes](#usage-notes)
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Initializing Form Controls
 *
 * Instantiate a `FormControl`, with an initial value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'some value'
 *```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a form state object. The `value`
 * and `disabled` keys are required in this case.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl({ value: 'n/a', disabled: true });
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(control.status);    // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a sync validator.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(control.value);      // ''
 * console.log(control.status);     // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control using an options object.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a blur event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'blur'` to update on the blur `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a submit event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'submit'` to update on a submit `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'submit' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value
 *
 * You reset to a specific form state by passing through a standalone
 * value or a form state object that contains both a value and a disabled state
 * (these are the only two properties that cannot be calculated).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 *
 * control.reset('Drew');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value and disabled
 *
 * ```
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'VALID'
 *
 * control.reset({ value: 'Drew', disabled: true });
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'DISABLED'

 *

 *
 * ### Registering a single form control
 *
 * The following examples shows how to register a standalone control and set its value.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Use with ngModel
 *
 * Support for using the `ngModel` input property and `ngModelChange` event with reactive
 * form directives has been deprecated in Angular v6 and will be removed in a future version
 * of Angular.
 *
 * Now deprecated:
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [formControl]="control" [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * This has been deprecated for a few reasons. First, developers have found this pattern
 * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's
 * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply
 * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value
 * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like
 * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,
 * which has understandably caused some confusion.
 *
 * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which
 * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of
 * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic
 * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in
 * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.
 *
 * To update your code before support is removed, you'll want to decide whether to stick
 * with reactive form directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or
 * switch over to template-driven directives.
 *
 * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [formControl]="control">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.control.setValue('some value');
 * ```
 *
 * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev
 * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for
 * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:
 *
 * ```ts
 * imports: [
 *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this
 * pattern with a config value of `"always"`. This may help to track down where in the code
 * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.

 *

 * @see `FormControl`
 * @see `AbstractControl`
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Register `FormControl` within a group
 *
 * The following example shows how to register multiple form controls within a form group
 * and set their value.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * To see `formControlName` examples with different form control types, see:
 *
 * * Radio buttons: `RadioControlValueAccessor`
 * * Selects: `SelectControlValueAccessor`
 *
 * ### Use with ngModel
 *
 * Support for using the `ngModel` input property and `ngModelChange` event with reactive
 * form directives has been deprecated in Angular v6 and will be removed in a future
 * version of Angular.
 *
 * Now deprecated:
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [formGroup]="form">
 *   <input formControlName="first" [(ngModel)]="value">
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * This has been deprecated for a few reasons. First, developers have found this pattern
 * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's
 * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply
 * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value
 * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like
 * delaying updates with `ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,
 * which has understandably caused some confusion.
 *
 * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which
 * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of
 * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic
 * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in
 * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.
 *
 * To update your code before support is removed, you'll want to decide whether to stick with
 * reactive form directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to
 * template-driven directives.
 *
 * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [formGroup]="form">
 *   <input formControlName="first">
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.form.get('first').setValue('some value');
 * ```
 *
 * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev
 * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for
 * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:
 *
 * ```ts
 * imports: [
 *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'})
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this
 * pattern with a config value of `"always"`. This may help to track down where in the code
 * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of a group of `FormControl` instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the status values
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormArray`.
 *
 * When instantiating a `FormGroup`, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child registers the name for the control.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create a form group with 2 controls
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form group with a group-level validator
 *
 * You include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like `FormControl` instances, you choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, { validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form group
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *   one: new FormControl()
 * }, { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *

 * Syncs a nested `FormGroup` to a DOM element.
 *
 * This directive can only be used with a parent `FormGroupDirective`.
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the nested `FormGroup` to link, and
 * looks for a `FormGroup` registered with that name in the parent
 * `FormGroup` instance you passed into `FormGroupDirective`.
 *
 * Use nested form groups to validate a sub-group of a
 * form separately from the rest or to group the values of certain
 * controls into their own nested object.
 *
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 *

 *
 * The following example uses the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method to access the
 * associated `FormGroup`
 *
 * ```ts
 *   this.form.get('name');
 * ```
 *
 * ### Access individual controls in the group
 *
 * The following example uses the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method to access
 * individual controls within the group using dot syntax.
 *
 * ```ts
 *   this.form.get('name.first');
 * ```
 *
 * ### Register a nested `FormGroup`.
 *
 * The following example registers a nested *name* `FormGroup` within an existing `FormGroup`,
 * and provides methods to retrieve the nested `FormGroup` and individual controls.

/**
 * @description
 * Creates a top-level `FormGroup` instance and binds it to a form
 * to track aggregate form value and validation status.
 *
 * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on
 * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.
 *
 * You optionally export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key
 * (ex: `#myForm="ngForm"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying
 * `FormGroup` instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it
 * gives you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as
 * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.
 *
 * To register child controls with the form, use `NgModel` with a `name`
 * attribute. You may use `NgModelGroup` to create sub-groups within the form.
 *
 * If necessary, listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event emits the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.
 * To import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,
 * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, add the `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`
 * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is
 * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would
 * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Listening for form submission
 *
 * The following example shows how to capture the form values from the "ngSubmit" event.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Setting the update options
 *
 * The following example shows you how to change the "updateOn" option from its default using
 * ngFormOptions.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [ngFormOptions]="{updateOn: 'blur'}">
 *    <input name="one" ngModel>  <!-- this ngModel will update on blur -->
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Native DOM validation UI
 *
 * In order to prevent the native DOM form validation UI from interfering with Angular's form
 * validation, Angular automatically adds the `novalidate` attribute on any `<form>` whenever
 * `FormModule` or `ReactiveFormModule` are imported into the application.
 * If you want to explicitly enable native DOM validation UI with Angular forms, you can add the
 * `ngNativeValidate` attribute to the `<form>` element:
 *
 * ```html
 * <form ngNativeValidate>
 *   ...
 * </form>
 * ```

/**
 * @description
 * Creates a `FormControl` instance from a domain model and binds it
 * to a form control element.
 *
 * The `FormControl` instance tracks the value, user interaction, and
 * validation status of the control and keeps the view synced with the model. If used
 * within a parent form, the directive also registers itself with the form as a child
 * control.
 *
 * This directive is used by itself or as part of a larger form. Use the
 * `ngModel` selector to activate it.
 *
 * It accepts a domain model as an optional `Input`. If you have a one-way binding
 * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component
 * class sets the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax
 * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI always syncs back to
 * the domain model in your class.
 *
 * To inspect the properties of the associated `FormControl` (like validity state),
 * export the directive into a local template variable using `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar="ngModel"`).
 * You then access the control using the directive's `control` property,
 * but most properties used (like `valid` and `dirty`) fall through to the control anyway for direct access.
 * See a full list of properties directly available in `AbstractControlDirective`.
 *
 * @see `RadioControlValueAccessor`
 * @see `SelectControlValueAccessor`
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Using ngModel on a standalone control
 *
 * The following examples show a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute
 * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.
 *
 * In the context of a parent form, it's often unnecessary to include one-way or two-way binding,
 * as the parent form syncs the value for you. You access its properties by exporting it into a
 * local template variable using `ngForm` such as (`#f="ngForm"`). Use the variable where
 * needed on form submission.
 *
 * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for
 * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather
 * than the domain model's value on submit.
 *
 * ### Using ngModel within a form
 *
 * The following example shows controls using `ngModel` within a form:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Using a standalone ngModel within a group
 *
 * The following example shows you how to use a standalone ngModel control
 * within a form. This controls the display of the form, but doesn't contain form data.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form>
 *   <input name="login" ngModel placeholder="Login">
 *   <input type="checkbox" ngModel [ngModelOptions]="{standalone: true}"> Show more options?
 * </form>
 * <!-- form value: {login: ''} -->
 * ```
 *
 * ### Setting the ngModel name attribute through options
 *
 * The following example shows you an alternate way to set the name attribute. The name attribute is used
 * within a custom form component, and the name `@Input` property serves a different purpose.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form>
 *   <my-person-control name="Nancy" ngModel [ngModelOptions]="{name: 'user'}">
 *   </my-person-control>
 * </form>
 * <!-- form value: {user: ''} -->

 * ### Using select controls in a reactive form
 *
 * The following examples show how to use a select control in a reactive form.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Using select controls in a template-driven form
 *
 * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`
 * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Customizing option selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.
 * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const selectedCountriesControl = new FormControl();
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * <select [compareWith]="compareFn"  [formControl]="selectedCountriesControl">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired
 * for selects in Firefox and IE:
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350
 * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/
